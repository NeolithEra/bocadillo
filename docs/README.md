## Quick start

1. Install [Bocadillo] and the [Bocadillo CLI]:

```bash
pip install bocadillo bocadillo-cli
```

[bocadillo]: https://github.com/bocadilloproject/bocadillo
[bocadillo cli]: https://github.com/bocadilloproject/bocadillo-cli

2. Generate a project and `cd` into it:

```bash
bocadillo create hello
cd hello/
```

3. Edit the application script:

```python{6-8}
# hello/app.py
from bocadillo import App

app = App()

@app.route("/")
async def index(req, res):
    res.text = "Hello, world!"
```

4. Start a [uvicorn] server (hot reload enabled!):

[uvicorn]: https://www.uvicorn.org

```bash
uvicorn hello.asgi:app --reload
```

5. Say hello!

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8000
Hello, world!
```

6. Edit `app.py` to send "Hello, Bocadillo!" instead, then hit save. Uvicorn will pick up the changes and restart the application. Try it out again:

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8000
Hello, Bocadillo!
```

Tastes good! 🥪
