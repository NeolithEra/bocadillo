Hi all! A few months ago, I published a blog post on my personal blog in which I shared my story of becoming an open source maintainer by building Bocadillo: [How I Built A Python Web Framework And Became An Open Source Maintainer](https://blog.florimond.dev/how-i-built-a-python-web-framework-and-became-an-open-source-maintainer).

The community's response to this blog post was heart-warming. Since then, I've kept working on the framework and I'm enjoying the journey more than ever. I haven't written much more about it, but that's going to change becauseâ€¦

Today, I'm excited to announce that **Bocadillo is launching an official blog**, right here on our official website! ðŸ™Œ

Do you wonder why, and what for? Let me explain.

## Motivations

As far as news, announcements and release notes are concerned, Bocadillo's main communication channel so far has been our Twitter account, [@bocadillopy](https://twitter.com/bocadillopy).

I think setting up that account relatively early was a very good decision in terms of giving Bocadillo an online presence. For sure, the developer community is particularly active on Twitter, and @bocadillopy has been gaining momentum recently â€” which is great!

All that said, Twitter as a news platform has its limitations. Not everyone's there, the amount of copy is limited (even with threads), and â€” most importantly â€” the content tends to get lost in the sea, and hard to discover.

That's why, in order to reach out to people outside the Twitter sphere, I thought it would be a good idea to set up a simple blog where you could find all things related to Bocadillo news, releases and announcements. We'll probably be cross-posting some of the non-administrative posts to our account on [DEV Community](https://dev.to/bocadillo), too.

## Enter: Breaking Bread

I decided to call this blog "Breaking Bread". Don't run away yet â€” it's not just a pun!

I learnt that the expression "breaking bread" means "sharing" in colloquial English ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_bread)) â€” which is exactly what we'll be doing over here.

Indeed, I want Breaking Bread to be **a central place to share announcements, release notes, news, and blog-friendly learning material** related to all things Bocadillo.

We hope you'll enjoy the blog posts you'll find here as much as we'll enjoy writing them!

~ Florimond.
